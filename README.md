# Beacon
Beacon is a website that focuses on providing mental health resources.
The site includes a generalized mental health survey on depression that is based on multiple reliable mental health survey sites. 

## Inspiration
Although the stigma around mental health has been decreasing, it is sometimes still unclear on where to find mental support. We wanted to facilitate the search and bring comprehensive help right to the user. Mental illnesses begin manifesting themselves in 50 percent of patients by the age of 14 and 75 percent of patients by the age of 25. Despite the early onset, between 76 and 85 percent of serious cases do not receive treatment in low and middle-income nations. That range drops to between 35 and 50 percent in high incomes countries, yet it still represents a huge margin.

Beacon represents a guidelight for those who do not know where to turn for mental health resources.
