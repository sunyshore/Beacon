# Beacon
Beacon is a website that focuses on providing mental health resources.<br>
The site includes a generalized mental health survey as well as many resources that are close to the user.

## Inspiration
Although the stigma around mental health has been decreasing, it is sometimes still unclear on where to find mental support. We wanted to facilitate the search and bring comprehensive help right to the user.
