                <h1>The truth</h1>
                According to WHO, depression is one of the biggest mental health disorders and the main causes of disability worldwide and affects an estimated 264 million people in the world. Both children and adults can get depression however, more women are affected than men.
                <br><br>
                <h1>Frequent concerns</h1>
                Many people do not seek mental health help due to barriers like cost, accessibility, and stigma towards mental health problems. 
                <br><br>
                Mental illnesses begin manifesting themselves in 50 percent of patients by the age of 14 and 75 percent of patients by the age of 25. Despite the early onset, between 76 and 85 percent of serious cases do not receive treatment in low and middle-income nations. That range drops to between 35 and 50 percent in high incomes countries, yet it still represents a huge margin. Mental illnesses account for over 20 percent of global healthcare costs yet many countries devote less than 3 percent of their healthcare budget to it.

                <h1>Our project</h1>
                Although the stigma around mental health has been decreasing, it is sometimes still unclear on where to find mental support. We wanted to facilitate the search and bring comprehensive help right to the user.
                <br><br>
                We plan to expand our site to include other mental health disorders further down the road.
                <br><br>
                Our logo and name were inspired by the saying "There is always light in the midst of the darkness". 
                We hope that our site will be able to help those in need of mental health help and to provide them with the correct resources.
